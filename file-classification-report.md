**Total Deletion Potential**: ~66KB from top 20 files

## Files That Depend on Orphaned Files

### Critical Dependencies to Review
1. **src/context/index.ts** (ORPHANED) - Has 1 import but 0 imported_by
   - May be an index file that exports unused context
   - **Recommendation**: Safe to delete if not dynamically imported

2. **src/features/index.ts** (ORPHANED) - Has 0 imports and 0 imported_by
   - Empty or unused feature index
   - **Recommendation**: Safe to delete

3. **src/features/dashboard/components/health/index.ts** (ORPHANED) - Has 6 imports but 0 imported_by
   - Index file that imports health components but isn't used
   - **Recommendation**: Safe to delete

## Recommendations for Safe Deletion

### High Priority (Large Files, Zero Dependencies)
1. **src/components/family/FamilyManagement.tsx** (5.2KB) - Complete family management feature
2. **src/components/Navigation.tsx** (4.2KB) - Replaced by new navigation system
3. **src/components/ai/** directory (7.7KB total) - Unused AI chat components
4. **src/features/accounts/components/Clean*.tsx** (7.7KB total) - Alternative account card implementations

### Medium Priority (Moderate Size, Clear Orphans)
1. **src/features/credit/components/** orphaned files (10.4KB total) - Unused credit score components
2. **src/components/examples/** directory (2.6KB) - Example/demo components
3. **src/components/viewport/ViewportGuardianDemo.tsx** (3.8KB) - Demo component

### Low Priority (Small Files, Utility Scripts)
1. **accessibility-audit.js** and **bundle-analyzer.js** - Utility scripts
2. Various small orphaned components under 1KB

## Files to Keep (Despite Being Marked Orphaned)

### Configuration Files (Should be ACTIVE)
- **eslint.config.js** - Essential for linting
- **playwright.config.ts** - Essential for testing
- **postcss.config.js** - Essential for CSS processing

### Potential Future Use
- **src/components/shared/ErrorBoundary.tsx** - Error boundaries are important for React apps
- Any files in **src/test/** directory - Test infrastructure

## Bundle Analysis Insights

### Production Bundle Composition
- **Total Bundle Size**: 2.14MB (JS: 1.86MB, CSS: 276KB)
- **Number of Chunks**: 105
- **Files Included**: 412 source files
- **Files Excluded**: 128 files (these are orphans)

### Largest Bundle Contributors
1. **vendor-charts-Do_mHxw5**: 434KB (charting libraries)
2. **Index-vD-uY9ve**: 190KB (main application chunk)
3. **index-BsOrS9Bq**: 150KB (secondary main chunk)
4. **vendor-react-BZjvl5xL**: 142KB (React libraries)
5. **vendor-ui-DvSaxMx6**: 91KB (UI components)

## Conclusion

The analysis reveals significant cleanup opportunities:

- **192 orphaned files** can be safely removed
- **~660KB of unused code** can be eliminated
- **35% of codebase** is not actively used
- Focus deletion efforts on the **top 20 largest orphaned files** for maximum impact

### Next Steps
1. **Phase 1**: Delete the top 10 largest orphaned files (saves ~45KB)
2. **Phase 2**: Remove entire orphaned feature directories
3. **Phase 3**: Clean up small orphaned utilities and components
4. **Phase 4**: Update build configuration to exclude orphaned paths

### Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Files with 0 imports and 0 imported_by
- **Medium Risk**: Files with imports but no imported_by (may be dynamically loaded)
- **High Risk**: Config files marked as orphaned (these should be ACTIVE)

This cleanup will significantly improve build performance, reduce bundle size, and make the codebase more maintainable.
