# Post-Mortem: White Screen Application Failure

**Date:** 2025-06-20

## 1. Summary

On 2025-06-20, the application was failing to render, presenting a blank white screen in both development and production builds. The root cause was identified as a **CSS build failure** originating from a misconfigured PostCSS setup in `postcss.config.js`. The configuration was failing to parse the `backdrop-filter` CSS property used for "glassmorphism" UI effects, which halted the entire CSS processing pipeline and prevented any styles from being loaded. The issue was resolved by correcting the `postcss.config.js` file.

## 2. Root Cause Analysis

The investigation followed these steps:

1.  **Initial Hypothesis (Incorrect):** Based on a previous incident, the initial suspicion was a malformed `@import` statement in `src/index.css`. Inspection of the file showed this was not the case, although the file had been recently modified.
2.  **Evidence Gathering:** Error logs from Vite showed a recurring error: `[vite:css] Unknown feature: "backdrop-filter"`. This pointed directly to an issue with the CSS build process.
3.  **Code Inspection:** Analysis of `postcss.config.js` revealed the critical misconfiguration:
    - The feature flag to enable `backdrop-filter` was incorrectly named (`'backdrop-filter': true` instead of the correct `'backdrop-filter-property': true`).
    - The `postcss-preset-env` stage was set to `2`, whereas `backdrop-filter` is a stage 3 feature.
    - The configuration redundantly included `autoprefixer` as a separate plugin, which is already handled by `postcss-preset-env`.

This configuration error caused the PostCSS parser to fail whenever it encountered the `backdrop-filter` property in the stylesheets, leading to a build failure that prevented the application from rendering.

## 3. Resolution

The issue was resolved by applying a patch to `postcss.config.js` with the following changes:

1.  **Corrected Feature Flag:** Changed `'backdrop-filter': true` to `'backdrop-filter-property': true`.
2.  **Updated Stage:** Increased the `postcss-preset-env` stage from `2` to `3` to better support modern CSS features by default.
3.  **Consolidated Configuration:** Removed the redundant `autoprefixer` plugin and merged its browser list into the `browsers` property of `postcss-preset-env` for a single source of truth.

After applying this fix, both the development (`npm run dev`) and production (`npm run build && npm run preview`) builds completed successfully, and the application rendered correctly.

## 4. Hardening and Prevention

To prevent similar issues and improve application resilience, the following measures were confirmed or implemented:

1.  **Global Error Boundary:** The application already had a robust `<ErrorBoundary>` component implemented in `src/App.tsx`, which wraps all routes. This ensures that any future JavaScript rendering errors will be caught gracefully without causing a white screen, displaying a user-friendly message instead.
2.  **Configuration Correction:** The corrected `postcss.config.js` now serves as the correct template for handling modern CSS features.

This incident highlights the importance of correct build tool configuration. A small error in the CSS processing pipeline was enough to take down the entire application.
