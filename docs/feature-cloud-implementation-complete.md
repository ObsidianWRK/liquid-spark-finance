## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Button Enhancement
```typescript
// Before: Static div elements
<motion.div>
  <span>{emoji}</span>
  <span>{text}</span>
</motion.div>

// After: Interactive button elements
<motion.button
  onClick={() => handleKeywordClick(keyword)}
  aria-label={`Navigate to ${keyword.text}`}
  type="button"
>
  <span>{emoji}</span>
  <span>{text}</span>
</motion.button>
```

### Navigation Logic
```typescript
const handleKeywordClick = (keyword: { text: string; route?: string }) => {
  if (keyword.route) {
    navigate(`/?tab=${keyword.route}`);
  }
};
```
