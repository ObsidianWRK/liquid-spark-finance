# Liquid-Spark Finance UI Migration Log

This document chronicles the slice-by-slice refactor that migrated the app from the legacy ‚Äúliquid-glass‚Äù design system to a clean, token-based architecture powered by colocated _feature_ folders and React-Query.

---

## Slice 1 ‚Äì Centralised Routing & Navigation

| Change | Notes |
| ------ | ----- |
| **`src/routes.ts`** created | Strongly-typed map of all route paths. |
| **`components/layout/Navigation.tsx`** | Refactored to render from the new `routes` map (sidebar-only navigation). |
| **`App.tsx`** | Consumes the same map; removed the obsolete top menu bar. |

Result ‚ñ∂ Single source of truth for navigation and a simplified UI shell.

---

## Slice 2 ‚Äì App Shell Clean-up

* Deleted `CleanDashboard`, `AppShell`, and other unused pages.
* Confirmed `tsc --noEmit` and Vite dev server run clean.

---

## Slice 3 ‚Äì Card Unification

| Action | Outcome |
| ------ | ------- |
| Wrote **codemod** (`scripts/codemod-replace-simple-glass-card.cjs`) | Replaced every `<SimpleGlassCard>` with `<Card>` from `@/components/ui`. |
| Added `components/ui/index.ts` barrel | Easier UI imports going forward. |
| Removed `SimpleGlassCard.tsx` & fixed residual imports | Zero occurrences left (confirmed via grep). |

---

## Slice 4 ‚Äì ‚ÄúLiquid-Glass‚Äù Purge

* Deleted obsolete CSS files (`liquid-glass*.css`, `glass.css`, etc.).
* Added Radix state-class safelist to `tailwind.config.ts`.
* Removed SVG filter helpers & menubar artefacts.

The codebase is now free of global glass CSS.

---

## Slice 5 ‚Äì Feature Folder Migration

Each domain now lives under `src/features/` with colocated **types**, **hooks** (React-Query), and an optional UI shim while components are moved.

| Domain | What moved/changed |
| ------ | ------------------ |
| **Budget** | `BudgetPlannerPage`, `types.ts`, `hooks.ts` ‚Üí `features/budget/` ‚Ä¢ Service wrapped in hooks. |
| **Credit** | `CreditScorePage`, `types.ts`, `hooks.ts` ‚Üí `features/credit/` ‚Ä¢ Component now data-driven via hooks. |
| **Insights** | `InsightsPage`, React-Query hooks, plus shimmed `NewInsightsPage`. |
| **Savings** | `SavingsGoals` ecosystem (GoalCard, GoalCreator, SavingsInsights) fully migrated; hooks provide caching & mutations. |
| **Transactions** | `TransactionDemo` routed through `features/transactions/`; initial `useTransactions` hook and types added. |

Shared `src/types/*` files now simply re-export their feature counterparts for backwards compatibility.

---

## Final Clean-up

* Removed all glass fallback components from migrated files.
* Deleted legacy `components/savings/` folder.
* Ensured **_no_** remaining `SimpleGlassCard` or `liquid-glass-*` classes (grep-verified).
* Global type-check passes.

---

### Next Steps (post-migration)

1. **Investments / Reports** ‚Äì replicate the feature pattern.
2. Replace mock services with real API/MSW handlers.
3. Add Jest + RTL tests for each feature hook & component.
4. Optional Storybook for tokens & cards.

> Migration complete ‚Äî the project is now modular, test-ready, and free from the heavy glass design. üéâ
