## 🚨 BLOCKERS
- TopBar hidden by CSS classes `hidden lg:flex` - needs viewport detection fix

## 📝 HYPOTHESES TO TEST
1. Navigation component was accidentally deleted in recent commits
2. CSS breakpoint logic is hiding nav at certain screen sizes
3. React Router or context provider changes broke nav rendering
4. Z-index stacking context issues
5. Import/export path issues after file restructuring

## 🔧 EMERGENCY ROLLBACK PLAN
If all fixes fail, rollback to last known good navigation commit:
- `git log --oneline --grep="nav" -10` to find candidates
- Cherry-pick working nav component from previous commit

## 📊 SUCCESS CRITERIA
- [ ] Top nav visible on all breakpoints  
- [ ] All navigation links functional
- [ ] Accessibility compliant (role="navigation", aria-labels)
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Passes lint + build
- [ ] Playwright tests pass
