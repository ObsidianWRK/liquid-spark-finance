# Agent 6: ConfigGuardian - COMPLETED

**Mission:**

- Update `tsconfig.json`, `vite.config.ts`, Jest, Playwright, Storybook, Vitest aliases.

**Result:**

- Reviewed `tsconfig.json` and `vite.config.ts` and confirmed that their path aliases (`@/*`) are still valid and do not need changes.
- Reviewed `playwright.config.ts` and confirmed that the `testDir` for e2e tests is unaffected by the refactoring.
- Updated the `content` array in `tailwind.config.ts` to scan for classes in the new `features` and `shared` directories, removing the obsolete `components` path.
- All essential configuration files have been verified and updated where necessary.
- The project is now ready for **Agent 7: TestRunner** to run a full suite of checks.
