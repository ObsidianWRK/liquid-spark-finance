# Agent 2: StructureArchitect - COMPLETED

**Mission:**
*   Analyse tree & code-owners
*   Output new hierarchy spec (`reports/new-structure.yml`).

**Result:**
*   Analyzed the current directory structure and identified key issues: duplication, scattered logic, and a monolithic `components` directory.
*   Designed a new feature-centric file structure inspired by Feature-Sliced Design.
*   Generated a detailed refactoring plan in `reports/new-structure.yml`, outlining the consolidation of shared code, elimination of the `domains` directory, reorganization of components into features, and co-location of tests.
*   This plan will guide the subsequent agents in executing the code modifications.
