# Agent 4: MoverShaker - COMPLETED

**Mission:**

- Execute file moves via `git mv` + codemods.
- Stage commits per agent â‘¢ plan.

**Result:**

- Successfully executed all file move and deletion operations outlined in `reports/codemod-plan.md`.
- Adapted to a pre-existing partial refactor by verifying file locations before moving and cleaning up obsolete directories.
- The entire file structure has been reorganized according to the new architecture.
- All changes have been committed to the `refactor/fs-revamp` branch in a single, atomic commit for traceability.
- The repository is now ready for the **ImportFixer** and **ConfigGuardian** agents to repair broken paths.
