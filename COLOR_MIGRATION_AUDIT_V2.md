# üé® Color Migration Accessibility Audit v2

## Objective
Document contrast compliance after replacing hardcoded colors with Vueni theme tokens.

## Scan Procedure
1. Build production bundle: `npm run build:production`.
2. Serve `dist/` locally and run `npx axe http://localhost:4173`.
3. Review violations for text and interactive elements.
4. Adjust failing colors to the nearest Vueni token or apply a subtle overlay.

## Findings
- ‚úÖ Most pages passed with no changes required.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `Dashboard` sidebar links had 3.8:1 contrast. Updated to `vueniTheme.colors.palette.primary`.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `AccountCard` balance text over card background was 4.1:1. Added `glass.overlay` background to meet 4.5:1.

## Next Steps
- Re-run axe-core scan after each color refactor to maintain compliance.
- Record additional issues in this file with date and component details.
